 # K-Nearest Neighbors Classification on Iris Dataset

##  Aim:
To implement a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal features.

##  Guidelines and Elaborated Procedure:

### 1. Import Required Libraries
Start by importing essential Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `sklearn` for machine learning utilities including dataset loading, model building, and evaluation

### 2. Load the Dataset
Use `load_iris()` from `sklearn.datasets` to load the Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### 3. Data Exploration and Analysis
- Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
- Use `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to understand the structure, types, and basic statistics of the data.
- Check for null values to ensure data quality.
- Use seaborn’s `pairplot()` to visually explore the relationships between features based on species.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- Separate the features (X) and target labels (y).
- Convert numeric labels into class names (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a mapping dictionary.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`, typically with a 70-30 split ratio.

### 5. Build the KNN Model
- Instantiate the `KNeighborsClassifier` with a chosen number of neighbors (e.g., 3).
- Fit the model to the training data using `fit()`.

### 6. Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model
- Use the `predict()` method to generate predictions on the test set.
- Evaluate the model performance using:
  - `accuracy_score()` for overall correctness
  - `classification_report()` for precision, recall, and F1-score
  - `confusion_matrix()` to compare actual vs predicted labels

### 7. Visualize the Results
- Plot the confusion matrix using seaborn’s `heatmap()` for better interpretation.
- Label the axes and add a title for clarity.

### 8. Save the Output (Optional)
- Save the modified or predicted dataset using `df.to_csv()` for further use or documentation.

  This entire workflow ensures a structured approach to solving a classification problem using K-Nearest Neighbors and allows effective evaluation using both quantitative metrics and visualizations.
